        <p>
      This is a member-owned and operated business focused on the arts and not profits which was founded in 1991 by a group of talented Champlain Island crafters offering quirky and beautiful products in Vermont. 
          
      Our first home was in the small front room of the North Hero building that now houses the Chamber of Commerce.    
          
      As word of our successful first two seasons spread, more and more artisans sought to join us, and we found ourselves looking for larger space.   Eventually, we found space behind Hero's Welcome.  
         
      Looking to be a store front and not behind anyone, the ICS settled into a former Catholic Church. After six years it was time to move south.

      ICS had the opportunity to partner with the Town of South Hero and plant its flag on Route 2.

          Over the years the ICS has  grown into a must-see destination for Islanders and visitors alike.  In response to interest the ICS made space to provide art classess to the community.  You should come see for yourself!
