        <h5 class="mt-0">From humble beginnings</h5>
        <p>
      This member owned and operated business focused
       on the arts and not profits 
       
       was founded in 1991 by a group of talented Champlain Island crafters offering quirky and beautiful products. 
          
      The first home was in the small front room of the North Hero building that now contains the Chamber of Commerce.    
          
      As word of the successful first two seasons spread, more and more artists joined, and we found ourselves looking for larger space.   Eventually, we found a place behind Hero's Welcome.  
         
      Looking to be a store front, the ICS settled into the nearby Catholic Church. After six years there it was time to move south.

      ICS had the opportunity to partner with the Town of South Hero by planting it's flag on Route 2.

          Over the years the ICS has grown into a must-see destination for Islanders and visitors alike.  In response to interest the ICS provides art classess to the community.  You should come see for yourself!
